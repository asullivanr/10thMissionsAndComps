Paste the contents of InventoryLimitedArsenal.sqf into the Eden editor console. It will then output a list into your clickboard that then can be used in the creation of a limited arsenal box.

# Usage
Place units on a random map, change the units in arsenal to whatever gear you want the unit to have. Repeat that till you have a small collection of units with all approved gear. Then use this script in the console to get the output class names of every unit on the map.
